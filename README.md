## Anaylsis and Organizing Stock Data over Multiple Years

The goal of this project is the clean or organize the data of several hundred stock market prices over several years. Another goal was to pull out important data, like the yearly change of a particular ticker or the greatest change out of all the tickers in a given year. There will be screenshots with the organized data and a file with the code used to clean up the Excel file. 

Opening up the file with the code will show the process of how the data in the screenshots were transformed. Our instructor gave the class a few hints and a skeleton code to get started. First, I declared variables, my the first row heading, and guarded against any weird things that could happen with the data, like have a 0 in the numerator. Then I calculated the changes, and programmed some cosmetic changes. Next, I calculated the data for the greatest increase. Finally, throughout the code I need to make sure that it would work on all the tabs. 

The screenshots will show the first several rows of the raw data. Then it will show the changes for each of the tickers. The final set of columns will show the greatest increase, greatest decrease, and greatest total volume. 

Hopefully, this program will split up the data by ticker and then show key tickers will big changes to look out for.
